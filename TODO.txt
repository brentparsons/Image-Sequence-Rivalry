Filmstrip Rivalry To-Do

Add target image to TYPES
Need to specify left and right image sequences
- targets also need to be counterbalanced across eyes
And so need to specify different left and right image file paths
Finesse sounds
Calculate target detection accuracy, broken down by triplet, sequence position, and eye
Add feedback for missed targets?
Accuracy displayed to subjects at the end of each block should be target detection accuracy
